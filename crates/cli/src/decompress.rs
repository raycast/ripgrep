/// simplicity and portability of using external commands such as `gzip` and
/// `xz`. This does impose the overhead of spawning a process, so other means
/// for performing decompression should be sought if this overhead isn't
/// acceptable.
///
/// A decompression reader comes with a default set of matching rules that are
/// meant to associate file paths with the corresponding command to use to
/// decompress them. For example, a glob like `*.gz` matches gzip compressed
/// files with the command `gzip -d -c`. If a file path does not match any
/// existing rules, or if it matches a rule whose command does not exist in the
/// current environment, then the decompression reader passes through the
/// contents of the underlying file without doing any decompression.
///
/// The default matching rules are probably good enough for most cases, and if
/// they require revision, pull requests are welcome. In cases where they must
/// be changed or extended, they can be customized through the use of
/// [`DecompressionMatcherBuilder`](struct.DecompressionMatcherBuilder.html)
/// and
/// [`DecompressionReaderBuilder`](struct.DecompressionReaderBuilder.html).
///
/// By default, this reader will asynchronously read the processes' stderr.
/// This prevents subtle deadlocking bugs for noisy processes that write a lot
/// to stderr. Currently, the entire contents of stderr is read on to the heap.

///
